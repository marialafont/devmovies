## Design & Planning

### Initial Prototype

The project began with a **Figma prototype** that served as a visual guide for the overall design direction and component structure. The prototype helped establish:

- Color scheme and theming foundations
- Component hierarchy and layout patterns
- User interaction flows and navigation
- Responsive breakpoints and mobile adaptations

> **Note**: The initial Figma design was used as a reference and underwent iterative improvements during development based on UX testing and technical constraints.

**Figma Reference**: [Design Prototype](https://www.figma.com/design/onavaSMM917cKGLOnjPLBM/DevMovies?node-id=0-1&m=dev&t=mDYEKmck82122lWQ-1) *(Design served as initial guidance with modifications made during development)*

### Design System

A consistent design system was implemented using:
- **Shadcn UI**: Pre-built accessible components
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling approach
- **Radix UI**: Unstyled, accessible primitives

### Architecture Patterns

#### Component Composition
- **Compound Components**: Flexible, declarative APIs
- **Render Props**: Dynamic content rendering
- **Higher-Order Components**: Cross-cutting concerns

#### Data Flow
- **Unidirectional Data Flow**: Predictable state updates
- **Context + Custom Hooks**: Clean separation of logic/presentation
- **React Query**: Automated server state synchronization

#### Performance Patterns
- **Lazy Loading**: Code splitting for components
- **Memoization**: React.memo, useMemo, useCallback
- **Virtual DOM Optimization**: Efficient re-renders

## Feature Implementation

### Search System

**Components**: `SearchBar`, `MovieGrid`, `useMovieSearch`

- **Real-time validation** with custom form validation hooks
- **Debounced API calls** to prevent excessive requests
- **Query sanitization** and error handling
- **Search state persistence** across navigation

### Pagination

**Implementation**: React Query's `useInfiniteQuery`

- **Automatic next page detection** based on API responses
- **Loading states** for initial and subsequent loads
- **Error boundaries** for failed requests
- **Smooth UX** with loading indicators

### Movie Details Modal

// Route-based splitting
const HomePage = lazy(() => import('../pages/HomePage'))
```

### React Query Caching

```javascript
// Optimized caching strategy
staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000,  // 5 minutes
cacheTime: 10 * 60 * 1000, // 10 minutes
retry: 1,
```

### Memoization Strategy
